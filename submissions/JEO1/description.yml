description:
  apply RPCA with weighted l1 norm, whose weight parameter (lambda) between nuclear 
  norm and l1 norm is set differently for each matrix component. we choose the value 
  of lambda for each frequency bin f to be var(A(f))/var(V(f)), where A and V are 
  the spectrogram of accompaniment and singing voice, respectively.
