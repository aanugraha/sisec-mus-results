  Deep neural network (DNN) based method using Common Fate Transform
  representation (CFT) on network input and output. The CFT representation includes phase information as well. In contrast to methods like UHL1, our proposed methd uses temporal context for both, input and output, which leads to improvement in temporal continuity.
